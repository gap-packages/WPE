# Introduction
The files in this directory are used to generate test files.

# Main Files
- `genTests.py` : generates all tests and copies them into `tst/files/gen`

# Output
- `*/out/` : dirs with `.tst` files

# Running Timings
In order to generate the tests and copy them into `tst/files/machine-generated` automatically, one needs to execute `python genTests.py [GAP]` from this directory, where `[GAP]` should be the path to a GAP installation.

## Dependencies
- python3
