  [33X[0;0YThe  generic  representation  of  wreath  product elements and in particular
  their  (sparse)  wreath cycle decompositions can be used to speed up certain
  operations in wreath products.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn   particular   this   package  provides  efficient  methods  for  finding
  conjugating    elements,    conjugacy   classes,   and   centralisers.   The
  implementations are based on [BNRW22] and references therein.[133X

  [33X[0;0YHere  we  include  a  list  of operations that take advantage of the generic
  representation of wreath product elements.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  include  python scripts in the [10Xdev/[110X directory that benchmark the [5XWPE[105X and
  native [5XGAP[105X implementations of these operations separately. The comparison of
  the  runtimes  admits  of  the conclusion that the [5XWPE[105X implementations are a
  magnitude faster than the native [5XGAP[105X implementations. We can now solve these
  computational  tasks  for  large  wreath  products  that were previously not
  feasible in [5XGAP[105X[133X
